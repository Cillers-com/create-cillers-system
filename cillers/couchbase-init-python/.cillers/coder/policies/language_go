       <specification>
           * A project should have a mod.go file. 
           * main.go should be the only file in the main package. All other files should be in sub packages. 
           * The entry point to the application should be the main function in the main.go file.
           * The main function should call another function called 'app' that returns an error if unsuccessful.
           * The main function should exit with a non-zero error if the 'app' function returns an error.
           * The main and app functions should be the only functions in the main.go file. All other functions
           should be in other files. 
           * If the project is small with less than 8 files, new go files should be created in the lib package unless
           otherwise specified.
